# How to execute
- If you have already a predefined package.json file, run ``npm i`` in the specific server.js folder to install dependencies
- (If you don't have a package.json yet, for this tutorial, you need to install express)
  - ``mpn i express``
- Then (in the specific subfolder) execute ``node server.js``

If you use a git repository, don't forget to exclude the node_modules by adding them to your .gitignore


> Hint: You need npm & node (https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
